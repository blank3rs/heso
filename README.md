# heso

**A browser for agents, not for humans.**

One 7.65 MB Rust binary. No Chromium. No Node. No `npm install playwright`.
Fetches, parses, runs JS, holds a stateful page session across clicks, hands back content-hashed JSON you can sign, diff, and **replay byte-for-byte**.

</div>

---

## The problem

Every agent framework today — Browser Use, Stagehand, Skyvern, Operator — is a Python or Node loop wrapped around Playwright wrapped around **240 MB of headless Chromium**.

Your agent is reading a docs page. Filling a login form. Clicking through a checkout.

It does not need Skia. It does not need Blink's layout engine. It does not need the compositor, the GPU pipeline, WebGL, canvas, or the video stack. That is roughly **70% of why Chromium is huge** — and 100% of why it's slow to start, painful to deploy, and miserable to run at scale.

You're paying for a rendering engine to render pixels nobody will ever look at.

## The bet

Keep the boring half of the browser — fetch, parse, JS, DOM, cookies, forms, clicks, sessions, sandboxing.

Drop the rendering half.

Ship it as one binary.

## The "holy shit" demo

```console
$ heso eval-dom https://news.ycombinator.com \
    'Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".titleline > a")).slice(0,5).map(a => a.textContent)'
{
  "ok": true,
  "url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/",
  "value": [
    "The foundations of a provably secure operating system (PSOS) (1979) [pdf]",
    "GenCAD",
    "Crystals found inside wreckage from the first nuclear bomb test",
    "It is time to give up the dualism introduced by the debate on consciousness",
    "I turned a $80 RK3562 Android tablet into a Debian Linux workstation"
  ]
}
```

Five real story titles, off the live wire, fetched + parsed + JS-evaluated, in **under 400 ms**, from a **7.65 MB single binary**.

No Chromium. No Node. No browser download. Just `cargo build && ./heso`.

## Why this matters

|  | heso | Playwright + Chromium |
|---|---|---|
| Install size | **7.65 MB** (measured) | ~240 MB + Node + browser bundle |
| Cold start (`--help`) | **15 ms** (measured) | 1–2 seconds |
| Per-target wall-clock (mean of 8 real URLs) | **125 ms** (measured) | **336 ms** (measured) |
| Peak RSS after extracting from 14 sites | **17 MB** (measured) | 100+ MB per browser |
| Deploy unit | one static binary | runtime + browser + driver |
| Reproducibility | content-hashed, seeded RNG, virtual clock | non-deterministic |
| Audit trail | every fetch → signable receipt | nothing |
| Rendering pixels | ✗ — that's the point | ✓ |

**Measured head-to-head: heso is 2.69× faster** than Playwright on the same 8 URLs (same machine, same network, same probe). Biggest wins on docs sites — MDN 7.63×, docs.rs 5.07× — where Chromium's startup cost dominates total wall-clock. Reproduce in [`bench/playwright/RESULTS.md`](bench/playwright/RESULTS.md).

See [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md) for the live compatibility scorecard — currently **14 / 14 passing** (example.com, HN, Wikipedia, httpbin, MDN, rust-lang.org, docs.rs, TodoMVC Preact/React/Vue, github.com, stripe.com, vercel.com). Reproduce with `cargo run -p heso-compat-suite -- --markdown COMPATIBILITY.md`. Eval cost is **1–95 ms** per page (sub-3 ms for static HTML extraction, 80–95 ms for JS-rendered SPAs that need framework script execution). Peak RSS climbs from **13 MB → 17 MB** across all 14 targets — heso holds onto a tiny working set even after running through that whole battery.

If your agent needs to *look* at a canvas, a video, or a CSS animation: use Chromium. heso is honest about that.

If your agent needs to *do things* on the agent-relevant half of the web — read, click, fill, extract, audit — heso is built for exactly that and nothing else.

## 30-second quickstart

```sh
cargo build --release -p heso-cli
./target/release/heso open https://example.com
```

That gives you a **plat** — an agent-shaped JSON map of the page:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/",
  "title": "Example Domain",
  "description": "...",
  "metadata": { "opengraph": {...}, "jsonld": [...] },
  "tree":     { "/": {...} },
  "actions":  [ { "ref": "@e0", "role": "link", "name": "More information..." } ],
  "plat_hash": "abf42bb66917095eb4cafdd4deb00c0686835102e713a3342b32093578007289"
}
```

Same page → same hash, byte for byte. On any machine. Forever.

That hash is the receipt. Sign it, store it, diff it next week, prove what the page said when your agent acted on it.

## One example per killer feature

**JS that mutates the DOM, on a real fetched page:**
```console
$ heso eval-dom https://example.com \
    'document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "Hijacked"; document.body.innerHTML.slice(0, 80)'
→ "<div><h1>Hijacked</h1><p>This domain is for use in documentation examples withou"
```

**Top-level `await` + `heso.flush()` for framework re-renders:**
```js
// Pass this as the <js> arg to heso eval-dom. The IIFE returns a
// Promise; heso awaits it via its microtask pump and serializes the
// resolved value. `await heso.flush()` yields to whatever the
// framework (Preact / React) queued for re-render.
(async () => {
    const input = document.querySelector('.new-todo');
    input.value = 'buy milk';
    input.dispatchEvent(new Event('keydown'));
    await heso.flush();           // let the framework's render microtask run
    return document.querySelector('.todo-list').innerHTML;
})()
```

**Click a real link through the JS event model:**
```console
$ heso find https://news.ycombinator.com --role link --name "more"
→ { "ref": "@e220", "role": "link", "name": "More" }

$ heso click https://news.ycombinator.com @e220
→ { "ok": true }
```

`fill` fires both `input` and `change`. `submit` walks the form. The `@e0/@e1/…` refs are stable across the whole click/fill/submit cycle.

**Determinism, on tap:**
```console
$ heso eval-js --seed 42 'Math.random()'  →  0.5140492957650241
$ heso eval-js --seed 42 'Math.random()'  →  0.5140492957650241
$ heso eval-js --seed 99 'Math.random()'  →  0.5052084295432834
```

`Math.random`, `crypto.getRandomValues`, `crypto.randomUUID` — all routed through a seeded ChaCha20 PRNG. Same seed, byte-identical output, on every machine, forever.

**Sites as filesystems:**
```sh
heso tree https://stripe.com
heso ls   https://stripe.com /pricing
heso cat  https://stripe.com /pricing/business
```

The page is a tree of heading-defined sections. Navigate it like a directory.

**Stateful replay — every action keyed, every page recoverable:**
```console
$ heso action-hash https://example.com '[{"verb":"open","url":"https://example.com/"},{"verb":"click","ref":"@e0"}]' > trace.json
$ heso replay trace.json
{
  "algorithm": "heso-trace-fp/v1",
  "trace_id": "632b9a3c…0ef3b2",
  "fingerprint_valid": true,
  "ok": true,
  "steps": [ … ]
}
```

The `trace_id` is a **BLAKE3 Merkle chain** over the URL + canonical actions. Anyone running the same trace anywhere gets the same hash — no keys, no central server, no central clock. Tampering breaks it. Replay carries one `JsSession` across every step: DOM mutations persist, `addEventListener` handlers fire, `setTimeout` chains progress through a virtual clock, `e.preventDefault()` on `<a href>` clicks stops navigation just like a real SPA router.

**Drop-in for any agent framework:**
```sh
heso serve     # JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout, stateful page sessions
```

Point Browser Use, Stagehand, or your own loop at the stdio transport. Swap Chromium out, leave the agent code alone.

## Who this is for

- **Agent framework builders** who are tired of shipping 240 MB of Chromium to do `document.querySelector`.
- **RAG pipelines** that need to ingest docs sites at scale without operating a headless Chromium farm.
- **Compliance / archival** workflows where "prove what the page said" matters more than "show me the pixels."
- **CI test suites** that need reproducible page snapshots without flaky timing.
- **Anyone wide-crawling for competitive intel** who wants ~100 ms per page on one machine instead of a fleet.

Not for: scraping data behind canvas, video, computed CSS layout, WebGL, or service workers. Use a real browser — that's what they're for.

## The precedent

[jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) (~50k LOC of JS) and [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) (~30k LOC) both proved that **a minimal DOM + JS environment handles the agent half of the web**. Both are slow because they're JS-in-JS. Both are framed as test tools, not as agent infrastructure.

Doing it in Rust against QuickJS is the obvious next move — and nobody has shipped it yet. That gap is the bet.

## Try it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Dongare/heso
cd heso
cargo build --release -p heso-cli

./target/release/heso open      https://example.com
./target/release/heso meta      https://stripe.com
./target/release/heso find      https://news.ycombinator.com --role link
./target/release/heso eval-dom  https://example.com 'document.title'
./target/release/heso serve     # JSON-RPC over stdio
```
