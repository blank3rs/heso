//! # modules
//!
//! Real `<script type="module">` execution — WHATWG HTML §8.1.3
//! "Module scripts" support, the Phase 1C item M-A unlock per the
//! M-A subagent brief. Without this module, every `<script
//! type="module">` was punted to classic-script evaluation and
//! `import` / `export` syntax raised a `SyntaxError`.
//!
//! ## What this module is and is not
//!
//! - **It is** the HTTP-backed module loader: a [`HttpResolver`]
//!   that normalizes import specifiers against the page URL, paired
//!   with a [`HttpLoader`] that serves cached sources (pre-seeded
//!   for inline modules) and synchronously fetches missing
//!   dependencies through the engine's shared
//!   [`reqwest::Client`]. Both implement rquickjs's
//!   [`rquickjs::loader::Resolver`] / [`rquickjs::loader::Loader`]
//!   traits so QuickJS's own module evaluator drives instantiation,
//!   topological compilation, and circular-import resolution. We
//!   own the network half; QuickJS owns the spec-compliance half.
//!
//! - **It is not** a bare-specifier resolver, an import-map
//!   interpreter, or a dynamic-`import()` shim. Those are
//!   M-B and M-C territory — the [`ModuleCache`] handle is
//!   intentionally exposed (`Rc<RefCell<_>>`) so M-B can install a
//!   filter on top of [`HttpResolver`] without touching this
//!   module's internals.
//!
//! ## Algorithm references
//!
//! - WHATWG HTML §8.1.3.1 "Module map" + §8.1.3.2 "Creating a
//!   module map" — the in-memory `(URL → source)` cache that
//!   makes `import "./foo.js"` from two different scripts hit one
//!   fetch. See [`ModuleCache`].
//! - WHATWG HTML §8.1.3.4 "Fetch a module script tree" — the
//!   recursive resolve-then-fetch pump. QuickJS drives it; our
//!   [`HttpLoader::load`] supplies the source on each step.
//! - WHATWG HTML §8.1.3.5 "Resolve a module specifier" — the
//!   relative-URL rule [`HttpResolver::resolve`] implements via
//!   [`url::Url::join`]. Bare specifiers fall through unchanged
//!   (no import map yet — M-B's job).
//!
//! ## OSS we lean on
//!
//! rquickjs 0.11 ships
//! [`BuiltinResolver`](rquickjs::loader::BuiltinResolver) +
//! [`BuiltinLoader`](rquickjs::loader::BuiltinLoader) — perfect
//! for pre-seeded inline modules — but their "modules must be
//! registered up-front" model can't grow to "fetch `./foo.js`
//! lazily on first import." We extend the same trait surface with
//! a cache that the engine pre-seeds for inline `<script
//! type="module">` bodies and that the loader falls back to HTTP
//! for everything else. QuickJS's module evaluator (the C-side
//! `js_resolve_module` recursion) handles the topological + cyclic
//! cases identically to V8 — we only have to feed it source.
